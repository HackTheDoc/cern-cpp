# Cern Lang (CPP Compiler)

Cern is a desktop application programming language.
It aims to be simple and make game dev easier.

The name is inspired by Cernunnos, the gallic god of forest.

This compiler is written in CPP, but a futur one will be self-hosted.

## Building

Requires `gcc` on a Linux operating system.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hackthedoc/cern-cpp
$ cd cern-cpp
$ make
```

Executable will be `cern` in the `build/` directory.

> The compiler will later be available from the release section (when it will have enough feature to actually do stuff).
