# Cernunnos Lang (CPP Compiler)

Cernunnos is a desktop application programming language.
It aims to be simple and make game dev easier.

This compiler is written in CPP, but a futur one will be self-hosted.

## Building

Requires `gcc` on a Linux operating system.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hackthedoc/cernunnos-cpp
$ cd cernunnos-cpp
$ make
```

Executable will be `cern` in the `test/` directory.

> The compiler will later be available from the release section (when it will have enough feature to actually do stuff).

## Credits

This compiler is greatly inspired from the [hygrogen](https://github.com/orosmatthew/hydrogen-cpp) lang compiler project from *orosmatthew*.

I base it on his videos and add personal modification on it.
